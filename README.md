This chat app allows a user to sign up and chat with every user who has signed up. And the user can post in group as well. The group chat room is titled MainChat, but a user can change chat rooms at any time. 
In Mainchat channel, number of users logged in can be seen. 

Channel name can be changed anytime a user wants. A user can sign up using his emailid. Once an user logs in, he is given an option to choose from a personal chat/group chat.
If an user clicks on Personal Chat, a list of users will be displayed from which he can select whom to send a message too.
